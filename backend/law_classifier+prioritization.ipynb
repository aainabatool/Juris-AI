        "case_text = \"Zakia Bibi, a resident of the Gujjar nullah community in Karachi, lived with her husband Shahid in a home established over years. In November 2021, the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), acting on a Supreme Court directive, conducted an anti-encroachment operation to clear stormwater channels following 2020 floods. The eviction targeted informal settlements blamed for blocking waterways, affecting up to 12,000 homes and 96,000 people, many with utility connections or leases. No adequate notice or consultation was provided; demolitions occurred abruptly, destroying homes without warning. On November 7, 2021, bulldozers razed Zakia Bibi's house while she and her husband were present, leading to Shahid suffering a heart attack from the shock. Authorities informed her compensation would not arrive for six months, leaving the elderly couple homeless and sleeping under the open sky. Her son earned only Rs20,000 monthly, insufficient for rent. Alleged human rights violations include lack of notice, no consultation or resettlement assistance, destruction of personal property, and cruel treatment exacerbating health issues, violating rights to adequate housing, health, and security of person. The government justified the action under anti-encroachment laws but failed to provide alternatives or immediate aid, worsening poverty and environmental harms like continued flooding. Four days later, on November 11, 2021, Zakia Bibi died of a heart attack, highlighting the lethal impact on vulnerable residents. Activists noted this as part of a pattern causing health crises in affected communities, with no accountability or remedies offered.\"\n",
